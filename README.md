# Classification-CNN-Models-with-Keras--CIFAR10-image-collection

In this project, classification of images will be performed using CNN models via the Keras library.

Images of 10 categories was obtained from the CIFAR10 image collection dataset, containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The dataset contains color images of size 32x32 pixel, and their categories are numbered as follows:

0: airplane 1: automobile 2: bird 3: cat 4: deer 5: dog 6: frog 7: horse 8: ship 9: truck

This project was specifically focused on exploring the optimization process of CNNs.
